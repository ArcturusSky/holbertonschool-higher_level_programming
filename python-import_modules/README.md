## Glossary

**A**
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Symbols that represent basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.

**B**
- **`break`:** A statement used to exit a loop prematurely.

**C**
- **Comments:** Lines in the code that are ignored by Python, used for documentation.
- **`continue`:** A statement used to skip the rest of a loop iteration and proceed to the next one.

**F**
- **Function:** A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

**I**
- **`if` Statement:** A conditional statement that runs a block of code only if the condition is true.
- **Indentation:** The use of spaces or tabs to define code blocks in Python.

**L**
- **Loops:** Constructs that repeat a block of code until a condition is met (`while`, `for`).

**P**
- **`pass`:** A statement used as a placeholder when no code is needed.

**R**
- **`range()`:** A function that generates a sequence of numbers.

**S**
- **Scope:** The region of the program where a variable is accessible.

**T**
- **Traceback:** An error message showing where and why a program crashed.
 

## Introduction to modules

In Python, a **module** is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules help you organize and reuse code efficiently. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended.

**Key Point:**

  - **Modules** allow you to split your program into multiples files for easier maintenance.
  
  - They help avoiding code duplication by allowing the reuse of functions and variables across different programs.

*Example:*

*Let's create a file name `fibo.py` with the following content:*

```python
# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(number):    # Write Fibonacci series up to number
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < number:
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

def fib2(number):   # Return Fibonacci series up to number
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < number:
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a+b
    return result

```

You can then **import** this **module** and use it's functions:

```python

import fibo

fibo.fib(1000) # Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
print(fibo.fib2(100)) # Output : [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

```

## Creating and using modules

To use a module, you **import** it into your script. You can importe an entire module or specific attributes from it.

### Importing the whole module

```python

import fibo
fibo.fib(500)
```

### Importing specific attributes

```python

from fibo import fib
fib(500)
```

### Importing all attributes (NOT RECOMMENDED)

```python

from fibo import *
fib(500)
```

### Aliasing modules and attributes

You can give a module or its attributes a different name:

```python

import fibo as fb
fb.fib(500)

from fibo import fib as fibonacci
fibonacci(500)

```

## Advanced module usage

### Executing modules as scripts

Modules can be run as standalone scripts. Use the following code to check if a module is being run as the main program:

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.arv[1]))

```

### The module search path

When importing modules, Python searches directories listed in `sys.path`. You can modify this path to include custom directories.

```python

import sys
sys.path.append('/your/custom/path')

```

## Packages

Packages are a way to organize modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is a directory containing an `__init__.py` file and submodules.

### Example package structure

```python

__init__.py
formats/
    __init__.py
    wavread.py
    wavwrite.py
effects/
    __init__.py
    echo.py
filters/
    __init__.py
    equalizer.py

```

### Importing from packages

```python

import sound.effects.echo
from sound.effects import echo
from sounds.effects.echo import echofilter
```

## Intra-package references

You can use absolute and relative imports withing packages to refer to submodules.

### Absolute Imports

```python

from sound.effects import echo

```

### Relative Imports

```python

from . import echo
from .. import formats
from ..filters import equalizer

```

## Package in multiple directories

Packages can be extended by modifying the __path__ attribute, which holds the directories where submodules are searched.
