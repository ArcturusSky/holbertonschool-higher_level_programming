## Classes and Subclasses

### Class (or Superclass)

- **Definition:** A general blueprint.
- **Purpose:** Defines common attributes and methods.

### Subclass (or Derived Class)

- **Definition:** A specialized version of the class.
- **Inheritance:** Inherits methods and attributes from the superclass without rewriting them.
- **Capabilities:**
  - **Modify:** Use `super().method()` to call the superclass's method and extend or modify it.
  - **Add:** Introduce new methods or attributes unique to the subclass.
  - **Override:** Redefine existing methods to change their behavior in the subclass.

### Instance

- **Definition:** A concrete copy of the class blueprint.
- **Purpose:** Created with specific values for its attributes.
- **Functionality:** Uses the class's methods but operates with the values provided during instantiation.

## Resume

- **Class/Superclass:** General template.
- **Subclass:** Specialized version with inherited and/or new features.
- **Instance:** A specific object created from the class blueprint with its own data.
